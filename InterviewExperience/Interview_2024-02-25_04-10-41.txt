Friday: Hello! I am Friday, your helpful Interviewer chat bot. Could you please introduce yourself?
User: my name is Ratan Prakash
Friday: Nice to meet you, Ratan Prakash! Can you tell me a little bit about your background and experience in data science?
User: justice and that that is why experience
Friday: It seems like there might have been a misunderstanding in your response. Could you please provide more details about your background and experience in data science?
User: I have a very good
Friday: It's great to hear that you have a good background in data science. Can you tell me about a data science project you have worked on and what was your role in that project?
User: no I cannot tell you
Friday: That's okay, Ratan Prakash. If you have any other projects or experiences you'd like to share, feel free to do so. Let's move on to another question. 

Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in data science?
User: I don't know
Friday: In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, where the correct output is provided. In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to learn patterns without any specific guidance. It's important to understand this distinction in data science. Keep learning and exploring!
User: ok understood
Friday: Great job on understanding the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, Ratan Prakash! It's a fundamental concept in data science. 

Next question: Can you explain what is meant by feature selection in the context of machine learning?
