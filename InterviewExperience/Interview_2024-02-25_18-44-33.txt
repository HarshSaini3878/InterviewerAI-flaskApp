Friday: Hello! I am Friday, your Interviewer chat bot. Could you please introduce yourself?
 
User: hello my name is Ratan Prakash I am studying computer science engineering
Friday: Nice to meet you, Ratan Prakash! Can you tell me about a project you have worked on that you are proud of?
 
User: I have built a gesture control Drone where a Drone was possibly controlled by hand gestures shown in a webcam of a laptop
Friday: That's impressive, Ratan Prakash! Creating a gesture control Drone sounds like a challenging and innovative project. Can you tell me about a time when you had to work in a team to achieve a goal?
 
User: yeah I have worked in a tech team where we built a autonomous driving racing car for various competitions held as formula Bharat competitions all around the world
Friday: Working on an autonomous driving racing car for competitions is a great example of teamwork, Ratan Prakash. Collaboration and communication are key in such projects. Can you explain the steps you would take to clean and preprocess a dataset before using it for analysis?
 
User: yes I will check for missing values in a data set I will also remove the redundant values which are not required for the model and only keep the features that are actually beneficial for the machine learning model required and I will also remove all the null values all the empty rows etc
Friday: Great job explaining the steps, Ratan Prakash! Checking for missing values, removing redundant features, and handling null values are crucial steps in cleaning and preprocessing a dataset for analysis. Keep up the good work!
 
User: thank u
Friday: You're welcome, Ratan Prakash! If you have any more questions or if you'd like to discuss anything else, feel free to let me know.
